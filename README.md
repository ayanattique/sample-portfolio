Iâ€™m an aspiring Data Analyst based in Lahore, Pakistan, with a passion for transforming raw data into meaningful insights. With a growing command over Python, SQL, Excel, and visualization tools, I'm dedicated to exploring real-world datasets and uncovering trends through clear, compelling analysis.

Currently, Iâ€™m building hands-on projects to sharpen my skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visual storytelling. My goal is to grow into a confident analyst capable of solving business problems using data-driven solutions.

When Iâ€™m not coding or experimenting with charts, I enjoy learning about the latest trends in data science and improving my communication and presentation skills to make data accessible and impactful.
